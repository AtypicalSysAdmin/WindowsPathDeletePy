# PythonGUIApp

A previledged fullstack python program with windows UI that can delete everypath using admin previledges with traceback logs

Please note that this just for educational purposes and personal labs, be aware of two things before using this app:

Logging system is not the best. but can be customized and scale up

This program uses admin previledges on start up, otherwise it cannot delete some path, duh


--how to run:

open terminal

cd to folder where main.py is

python main.py

pyinstaller is already cooked up by me if you don't like the terminal and you like double clicking, building it is a cake
